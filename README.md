# DnD_Api_app
A JSON API project that stores DnD builds for new players to sort through so they can immediately pick one up and start playing!
I want to build this because it would give me some good practice for web app development and allow for me to make an api that people could connect to for their own
Dnd related projects. 

As of 8/19/2021, I'm currently focusing on the base attributes a player needs like the character race, traits(strength, chrisma, etc.), and their class(not including sub
classes). In the near future I want to add more available data as I get to understand Dnd more and try to find ways to make it easier for other new players or veterans to find
standard builds and homebrews that fit their needs and make it more accessible.
